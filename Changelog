2023-12-05  Daniel Lo Nigro <d@d.sb> - 3.0.0-beta1
    * Bumped minimum .NET Core requirement to .NET Core 3.1
    * Implemented 64-bit support for Windows now that Gpg4Win ships with 
      a 64-bit build of GPGME. Non-Windows OSes already supported 64-bit.
      Note that this has changed the mechamism that gpgme-sharp uses to
      locate the corect GPGME DLL to use. Please file a GitHub issue if 
      this causes issues in your environment.

2009-06-29	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* PgpKey.cs: Corrected Sign(..), RevokeSignature(..) and 
	  DeleteSignature(..). You need to specify ONE uid and one or more
	  signature numbers. 
	* Added Samples directory.

2009-06-24	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* GpgmeCbsData.cs: Corrected double free() of cbsPtr.
	  Added thread safety for ReleaseCB(..)
	* All files: start to separate P/Invoke declarations (public -> 
	  internal). Make "internal" functions invisible to the user.

2009-06-22	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* First steps to fix 64bit problems (P/Invoke).
	* First steps to fix stacktrace with gpgme_data_new_from_cbs(..).
	  On Linux/Unix platforms _release_cb(..) is called AFTER the 
	  deconstructor ~GpgmeCbsData() has freed the user supplied cbs
	  structure with its callback functions. This will be a problem on
	  Windows platforms as well as soon as the number of parallel threads
	  and CPUs raises.
	* Added global/local locking for some functions that call 
	  Marshal.FreeCoTaskMem(..).


2009-06-15	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	  Windows platforms (See BUGS for more information).

2009-06-09	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* GpgmeCbsData.cs: 
	  GpgmeStreamData.cs:
	  GpgmeFileData: Corrected CanRead, CanWrite, CanSeek and CanRelease.
	* Tested encryption of memory based input buffer to file/stream based 
	  output buffer.
	* Tested signature of file/stream based input buffer to file/stream
	  based output buffer.
	* GpgmeMemoryData.cs: Rename of Dispose(bool) to ReleaseMemoryData().

2009-06-05	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* GgpmeData.cs: now inherited from Stream.
	  Implemented Read(..), Write(..), Seek(..), SetLength(..), etc. where
	  possible.

2009-06-04	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* Global: renamed method names (*PGP* -> Pgp)
	* corrected AddSubkey for PGP keys
	* corrected key algorithm types and capability

2009-05-19	Daniel Mueller <daniel@danm.de>

	* AlgorithmCapability.cs: Added GetKeyUsageText(..)
	* GnupgKeyParms.cs: Corrected PGP key creation. It is now possible to
	  create RSA (Sign/Encrypt/Auth) key pairs.
	* Global: changed PubKey* to Pubkey*, SubKey* to Subkey*
